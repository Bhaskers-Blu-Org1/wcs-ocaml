# match_clause=INT (default=2)
#     Indentation for clauses inside a pattern-match (after arrows).
#
#         match foo with
#         | _ ->
#         ..bar

# strict_with=<always|never|auto> (default=never)
#     If `never', match bars are indented, superseding `with', whenever
#     `match with' doesn't start its line. If `auto', there are
#     exceptions for constructs like `begin match with'. If `always',
#     `with' is always strictly respected.
#
#     Example with `strict_with=never,with=0':
#         begin match foo with
#         ..| _ -> bar
#         end

strict_with=always

# max_indent=<INT|none> (default=4)
#     When nesting expressions on the same line, their indentations are
#     stacked in some cases so that they remain correct if you close them
#     one per line. However, this can lead to large indentations in
#     complex code, so this parameter sets a maximum indentation. Note
#     that it only affects indentation after function arrows and opening
#     parens at the ends of lines.
#
#         let f = g (h (i (fun x ->
#         ....x)
#           )
#         )
